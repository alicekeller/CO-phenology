# Colorado Phenology Exploration
Do you ever wonder how a plant knows to start making leaves in the Spring? I did, so I obtained data from the [USA National Phenology Network](https://www.usanpn.org/usa-national-phenology-network) and explored.

# Why?
I was most interested in the phenology (the study of the timing of cyclic patterns in nature) of when plants "break their buds", or start producing leaves. Data is from Colorado because I call it home.

Turns out, the date of first bud break has been getting earlier and earlier over the past 10 years. What factors are having the largest effects? That's what I set out to find.
